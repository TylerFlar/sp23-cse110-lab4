### Question 1:
**'values added: 20'**
### Question 2:
**'final result: 20'**
### Question 3:
**'values added: 20'**
### Question 4:
The code will return an error at line 13. This is because the **'result'** variable is now declared with **'let'** inside the **'if'** statement, which means it has block scope. The **'console.log'** in line 13 is outside that block scope, so it cannot access the **'result'** variable, causing the **'ReferenceError'**.
### Question 5:
The code will return an error before reaching line 9. The error message will be: **'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.'** This is because the **'result'** variable is declared with **'const'**, which means it cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment. Since **'result'** is initially assigned to 0 and then you try to reassign it with the sum of **'num1'** and **'num2'**, the error occurs.
### Question 6:
Line 13 would have the same issue. However it would also not be accessible due to not being in the same block scope.
